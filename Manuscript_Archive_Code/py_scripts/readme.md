python scripts used to run MARIO (devo version) during the prodcution of manuscript. Note the current version should not run this script as grammar etc has slightly changed. Deposited as record.

```Figure5_PANINI-post-imaging-processing.ipynb``` contains the validation image of the singal thresholds in the PANINI experiment, thus it is quite large (so it won't compile directly on github page). If you wish to browse the file, we suggest quick download with 'wget' with the link and upload to eg. google colab to easily check the image records.
